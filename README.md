# Bharath-intern_task3
Task 3 - This task consists of classifying the Iris flower Species using K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm. The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm is a popular machine learning technique used for classification and regression tasks. It relies on the idea that similar data points tend to have similar labels or values. K is the number of nearest neighbors to use. For classification, a majority vote is used to determined which class a new observation should fall into.
